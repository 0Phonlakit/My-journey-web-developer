### Day 1: Basic HTML elements
#### I began my journey into web development by learning about the basic elements of HTML. These elements are used to structure and format the content of a web page.
#### I learned about the following elements:
#### &middot; Heading elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) are used to define the headings of a web page.
#### &middot; Paragraph elements (e.g., `<p>`) are used to define blocks of text.
#### &middot; Void elements (e.g., `<hr />`, `<br />`) do not have a closing tag. They are used to separate sections of a web page or to break lines of text.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page to recommend my favorite movies. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the page, a paragraph to introduce the topic, and a list of my favorite movies.
