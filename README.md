<hr /> 

### Day 1: Basic HTML elements
#### I began my journey into web development by learning about the basic elements of HTML. These elements are used to structure and format the content of a web page.
#### I learned about the following elements:
#### &middot; Heading elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) are used to define the headings of a web page.
#### &middot; Paragraph elements (e.g., `<p>`) are used to define blocks of text.
#### &middot; Void elements (e.g., `<hr />`, `<br />`) do not have a closing tag. They are used to separate sections of a web page or to break lines of text.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page to recommend my favorite movies. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the page, a paragraph to introduce the topic, and a list of my favorite movies.

### Day 2: Intermediate HTML elements
#### On the second day of my web development journey, I learned about the intermediate elements of HTML. These elements are used to add more structure and functionality to web pages.
#### I learned about the following elements:
####  &middot; Nesting and Indentation elements are used to create lists of information. Unordered lists (e.g., `<ul>` and `<li>`) are used to list items without order, while ordered lists (e.g., `<ol>` and `<li>`) are used to list items in order. Nesting lists within lists can be used to create hierarchical lists.
#### &middot; Anchor elements (e.g., `<a>` and `<href>` attributes) are used to create hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow users to click on a word or phrase to navigate to another web page.
#### &middot; Image elements (e.g., `<img>` and `<src>` attribute) are used to add images to web pages. The src attribute specifies the location of the image file. The `<alt>` attribute provides a description of the image for users who cannot see it.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a birthday invitation card. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the card, a list of the guest's names, and an image of a birthday cake.

### Day 3: Creating Multi-Page Websites
#### On the third day of my web development journey, I learned how to create Multi-Page websites. This involved learning about the following elements:
#### &middot; File paths are used to specify the location of files. For example, the path `../Folder` refers to a folder that is one level above the current folder. The path `./picture.img` refers to a file that is in the same folder as the current file.
#### &middot; Webpages are the individual pages that make up a website. Each webpage has its own HTML file.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a portfolio. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the portfolio, a list of my skills, and a link to an about me page.

### Day 4: Basic CSS properties
#### On the fourth day of my web development journey, I learned about the basic properties of CSS. These properties are used to control the appearance of HTML elements.
#### I learned about the following properties:
#### &middot; Adding properties : 
#### <ul> <li>Inline properties are added directly to HTML elements, using the `style` attribute. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels: `<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">This is a heading</h1>`</li> 
#### <li> Internal properties are added to the `<style>` tag in an HTML document. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels on the current page: `<style> h1{font-size: 24px;} </style>` </li>
#### <li> External properties are added to an external stylesheet, which is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels on all pages of the website: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` </li> </ul>
#### &middot; Selectors : Selectors are used to select HTML elements to which CSS properties will be applied. There are many different types of selectors, each of which selects a different set of elements.
#### <ul> <li> For example, the following selector will select all `h1` elements: `h1{...}` </li>
#### <li> The following selector will select all elements with the class `red`: `.red {...}` </li>
#### <li> The following selector will select the element with the ID `my-id`: `#my-id {...}` </li> </ul>
#### To reinforce my understanding of these properties, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page about storing Spanish color vocabulary. I used the knowledge I had learned to style the page using CSS properties and selectors.

### Day 5: Additional Basic CSS Properties
#### On the fifth day of my web development journey, I learned about additional basic properties in CSS. These properties are used to control the appearance of HTML elements.
#### I learned about the following properties:
#### &middot; CSS Colors
#### <ul> <li>Global colors can be set using the color property in the <style> tag. For example, the following code will set the default color of all text on the page to red: `<style> color: red; </style>` </li>
#### <li>**Local colors** can be set using the `color` property on an individual element. For example, the following code will set the color of the `h1` element to blue:`<h1 style="color: blue;"> This is a heading</h1>` </li>
#### &middot; Font Properties
#### <ul> <li> Font size can be set using the font-size property. For example, the following code will set the font size of all text on the page to 24 pixels: `<style> font-size: 24px; </style>` </li>
#### <li> **Font family** can be set using the `font-family` property. For example, the following code will set the font family of all text on the page to Times New Roman: <style> `font-family: Times New Roman </style>`
#### &middot; CSS Box Model 
#### <ul> <li> The box model is a way of describing the layout of an HTML element. The box model consists of four parts: the width, height, border, and padding. </li>
#### <li> The `width` and `height` properties set the size of the element's content area. </li>
#### <li> The `border` property sets the width and style of the element's border. </li>
#### <li> The `padding` property sets the amount of space between the element's content area and its border. </li>
#### <li> The `margin` property sets the amount of space between the element and its surrounding elements. </li>
#### <li> The `<div>` element is a generic container element that can be used to group other elements together. </li> </ul>
#### &middot; Mini project on Beginner additional CSS
#### I used the knowledge I had learned to create a web page to display memes. I used the `<div>` element to group the meme images together, and I used the border property to add a `border` around the images. I also used the `font-size` and `font-family` properties to change the appearance of the text on the page.

### Day 6: Intermediate CSS Properties
#### On the sixth day of my web development journey, I learned about intermediate properties in CSS. These properties are used to control the layout of HTML elements.
#### I learned about the following properties:
#### &middot; Cascade
#### <ul> <li> `Padding` can be used to add space inside a text box to prevent the text from being too close to the box. The amount of space added is specified in pixels, ems, or other units. </li>
#### <li>`Margin` can be used to create a space around the outside of a box. The amount of space added is specified in pixels, ems, or other units. </li> </ul>
#### &middot; Combining Selectors
#### <ul> <li> Combining selectors allows you to select multiple elements or groups of elements with a single selector. For example, the selector `h1, h2` will select all `h1` and `h2` elements. </li>
#### <li> Adjacent selectors are used to select elements that are adjacent to each other. For example, the selector `.box > p` will select all `p` elements that are immediately inside a `.box` element. </li>
#### <li> Child selectors are used to select elements that are children of a particular element. For example, the selector `.box li` will select all `li` elements that are children of a `.box` element. </li>
#### <li> Descendant selectors are used to select elements that are descendants of a particular element. For example, the selector `li.done` will select all `li` elements that have the class `"done"`. </li> </ul>
#### <li> Combining selectors can be used to create complex selectors that select specific groups of elements. </li>
#### &middot; Positioning
#### <ul> <li> Positioning allows you to control the position of an element on the page. There are four types of positioning:
#### <li> `Static` is the default positioning type. Elements with static positioning are positioned according to the normal flow of the page. </li>
#### <li> `Relative` positioning allows you to move an element relative to its original position. </li>
#### <li> `Absolute` positioning allows you to move an element to any position on the page. </li>
#### <li> `Fixed` positioning allows you to move an element to a fixed position on the page, regardless of the scroll position of the page. </li>
#### &middot; Mini project on Intermediate CSS
#### <ul> <li> I used the knowledge I had learned to create a web page to store national flags. I used the `<div>` element to group the flag images together, and I used the `position` property to position the images. I also used the `padding` and `margin` properties to control the spacing around the images. </li>
