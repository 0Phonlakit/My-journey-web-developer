### Day 1: Basic HTML elements
#### I began my journey into web development by learning about the basic elements of HTML. These elements are used to structure and format the content of a web page.
#### I learned about the following elements:
#### &middot; Heading elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) are used to define the headings of a web page.
#### &middot; Paragraph elements (e.g., `<p>`) are used to define blocks of text.
#### &middot; Void elements (e.g., `<hr />`, `<br />`) do not have a closing tag. They are used to separate sections of a web page or to break lines of text.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page to recommend my favorite movies. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the page, a paragraph to introduce the topic, and a list of my favorite movies.

### Day 2: Intermediate HTML elements
#### On the second day of my web development journey, I learned about the intermediate elements of HTML. These elements are used to add more structure and functionality to web pages.
#### I learned about the following elements:
####  &middot; Nesting and Indentation elements are used to create lists of information. Unordered lists (e.g., `<ul>` and `<li>`) are used to list items without order, while ordered lists (e.g., `<ol>` and `<li>`) are used to list items in order. Nesting lists within lists can be used to create hierarchical lists.
#### &middot; Anchor elements (e.g., `<a>` and `<href>` attributes) are used to create hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow users to click on a word or phrase to navigate to another web page.
#### &middot; Image elements (e.g., `<img>` and `<src>` attribute) are used to add images to web pages. The src attribute specifies the location of the image file. The `<alt>` attribute provides a description of the image for users who cannot see it.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a birthday invitation card. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the card, a list of the guest's names, and an image of a birthday cake.
