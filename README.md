### Day 1: Basic HTML elements
#### I began my journey into web development by learning about the basic elements of HTML. These elements are used to structure and format the content of a web page.
#### I learned about the following elements:
#### &middot; Heading elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) are used to define the headings of a web page.
#### &middot; Paragraph elements (e.g., `<p>`) are used to define blocks of text.
#### &middot; Void elements (e.g., `<hr />`, `<br />`) do not have a closing tag. They are used to separate sections of a web page or to break lines of text.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page to recommend my favorite movies. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the page, a paragraph to introduce the topic, and a list of my favorite movies.

### Day 2: Intermediate HTML elements
#### On the second day of my web development journey, I learned about the intermediate elements of HTML. These elements are used to add more structure and functionality to web pages.
#### I learned about the following elements:
####  &middot; Nesting and Indentation elements are used to create lists of information. Unordered lists (e.g., `<ul>` and `<li>`) are used to list items without order, while ordered lists (e.g., `<ol>` and `<li>`) are used to list items in order. Nesting lists within lists can be used to create hierarchical lists.
#### &middot; Anchor elements (e.g., `<a>` and `<href>` attributes) are used to create hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow users to click on a word or phrase to navigate to another web page.
#### &middot; Image elements (e.g., `<img>` and `<src>` attribute) are used to add images to web pages. The src attribute specifies the location of the image file. The `<alt>` attribute provides a description of the image for users who cannot see it.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a birthday invitation card. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the card, a list of the guest's names, and an image of a birthday cake.

### Day 3: Creating Multi-Page Websites
#### On the third day of my web development journey, I learned how to create Multi-Page websites. This involved learning about the following elements:
#### &middot; File paths are used to specify the location of files. For example, the path `../Folder` refers to a folder that is one level above the current folder. The path `./picture.img` refers to a file that is in the same folder as the current file.
#### &middot; Webpages are the individual pages that make up a website. Each webpage has its own HTML file.
#### To reinforce my understanding of these elements, I completed a mini project in which I created a portfolio. I used the knowledge I had learned to create a heading for the portfolio, a list of my skills, and a link to an about me page.

### Day 4: Basic CSS properties
#### On the fourth day of my web development journey, I learned about the basic properties of CSS. These properties are used to control the appearance of HTML elements.
#### I learned about the following properties:
#### &middot; Adding properties : 
#### <ul> <li>Inline properties are added directly to HTML elements, using the `style` attribute. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels: `<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">This is a heading</h1>`</li> 
#### <li> Internal properties are added to the `<style>` tag in an HTML document. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels on the current page: `<style> h1{font-size: 24px;} </style>` </li>
#### <li> External properties are added to an external stylesheet, which is linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. For example, the following code will set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24 pixels on all pages of the website: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` </li> </ul>
#### &middot; Selectors : Selectors are used to select HTML elements to which CSS properties will be applied. There are many different types of selectors, each of which selects a different set of elements.
#### <ul> <li> For example, the following selector will select all `h1` elements: `h1{...}` </li>
#### <li> The following selector will select all elements with the class `red`: `.red {...}` </li>
#### <li> The following selector will select the element with the ID `my-id`: `#my-id {...}` </li> </ul>
#### To reinforce my understanding of these properties, I completed a mini project in which I created a web page about storing Spanish color vocabulary. I used the knowledge I had learned to style the page using CSS properties and selectors.
